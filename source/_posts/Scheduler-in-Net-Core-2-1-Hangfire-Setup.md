Background: 

I used to setup my project scheduler by using windows service then I find a better library to do this task. There are multiple reasons the first is Hangfire is free!!! and then it provide dashboard to monitor and control your scheduled tasks.

Options:

Before we get into this Hangfire tutorial make sure you compare all the libraries otherwise you need to refactor your application which is waste of time.
